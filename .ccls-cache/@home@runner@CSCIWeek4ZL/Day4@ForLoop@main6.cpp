// for loop:
// for (int i - 0; i <10; i++) The inital statement i should start at 0, the loop condition fails when i > 10 and is repeated as long as it's less than 10 the last part (i++) tells us to increase by 1 every loop.
// Used for doing some action a certain number of times.
// for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
// cout << i << " ";
// cout << endl;
// A while loop is typically used when you're unsure how often it needs to be looped. Though a while loop can technically do the same thing, SEE DAY 3.
// One statement doesn't need braces { }, though you can have them. However a group of them does require braces { } so they are associated together.
